# TESE_CJAM_2024
Repository describing the experiments associated with the doctoral thesis whose main theme is the superconvergence of non-3GPP wireless communication technologies and the 5G core - pathways to superconvergence.


## Experiments
Next, we will present present a series of experiments focused on the integration and performance evaluation of User Equipment (UE) with non-3GPP wireless communication technologies and their interaction with the 5G core network. These experiments aim to explore the pathways to achieving superconvergence, examining various scenarios and configurations to assess the efficacy, reliability, and potential challenges of seamless integration.

  * [Experiment 1](https://github.com/LABORA-INF-UFG/NetSoft2020-Tutorial4-Demo1-Exp1 "Demo 1 - Experiment 1") - Methodology and configuration of UE-non-3GPP, N3IWF, and Free5GC.
